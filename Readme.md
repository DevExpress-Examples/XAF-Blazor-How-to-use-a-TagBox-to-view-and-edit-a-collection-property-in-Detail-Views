# XAF Blazor - How to use a TagBox to view and edit a collection property in Detail Views

There are a couple of child records, and it is required to display all available records in a compact manner, and link and unlink them from the master object quickly (for example, with check boxes or tokens/tags). When an item is selected, this means that this record is associated with the master object.

## Summary

We created a custom XAF Property Editor based on our [DxTagBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2) component. For more information, review the following concepts:
- [Property Editors](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113097/concepts/ui-construction/view-items/property-editors);
- [How to: Implement a Property Editor Based on a Custom Component (Blazor)](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/402189/task-based-help/property-editors/how-to-implement-a-property-editor-based-on-custom-components-blazor?p=netstandard);
- [Application Solution Components](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112569/concepts/application-solution-components).

To simplify this task, we used our built-in Component Model (`DxTagBoxModel`), Component Adapter (`DxTagBoxAdapter`), and Component Renderer (`DxTagBoxRenderer`).

## Implementation Steps

Create a `BlazorPropertyEditorBase` class descendant and follow the steps listed below:

1. Apply [PropertyEditorAttribute](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.Editors.PropertyEditorAttribute.-ctor(System.Type-System.String-System.Boolean)) to the editor and set the first attribute parameter to `IList` and the `isDefaultEditor` parameter to `false`. With these values, you can choose this Property Editor for a collection in the **Model Editor** , and this editor will not be marked as default.

2. Override the `CreateComponentAdapter` method. In this method, create a component model, create a `DataItem<string>` collection, populate it with object handles using the [IObjectSpace.GetObjectHandle](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.IObjectSpace.GetObjectHandle%28System.Object%29) method, and then assign this collection to the component model's `Data` property. Then, specify the component model's `ValueFieldName` and `TextFieldName` properties. They are used to bind the `DxTagBox` component.

3. Override the `ReadValueCore` method. This method is required to obtain a collection of values from a `PropertyValue`, loop through this collection, and update your component model's data.

4. Override the `WriteValueCore` method. Use this method to obtain data from the component model and then update the collection stored in the `PropertyValue` property.

5. Return `false` in the overridden `IsMemberSetterRequired` method to specify that the editor should not be read-only.

6. _Optional_. You may wish to slightly customize the Detail View layout for better appearance by following recommendations described at [Detail View Layout Customization](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112817/ui-construction/views/layout/view-items-layout-customization).
